# Calendar Assistant Workspace

**Open this folder in Cursor when you want calendar tools.** The calendar MCP is only loaded when this workspace is the active project.

- **For calendar help**: File → Open Folder → select `calendar-workspace`
- **For coding** (assistant-agent): File → Open Folder → select parent `assistant-agent`

This keeps calendar tools from appearing when you're writing code.

**First time**: Update `cwd` in `.cursor/mcp.json` to the full path of the assistant-agent project on your machine.
